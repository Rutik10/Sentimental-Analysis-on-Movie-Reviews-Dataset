# Sentimental-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews-Dataset


In this step-by-step guide, we will walk through the process of building a
Sentiment Analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify
movie reviews as positive or negative. Sentiment analysis is a popular Natural
Language Processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or
emotion expressed in a piece of text. We will use Python, TensorFlow, and Keras
to implement the RNN model and analyze the results.
